        <p>Modern web architecture has evolved significantly over the past decade. Today's applications need to be scalable, maintainable, and performant across various devices and network conditions.</p>

        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <p>When designing modern web architecture, several key principles should guide your decisions:</p>

        <h3>Scalability</h3>
        <p>Your architecture should be able to handle increased load without significant performance degradation. This involves both horizontal and vertical scaling strategies.</p>

        <h3>Maintainability</h3>
        <p>Code should be organized in a way that makes it easy to understand, modify, and extend. This includes proper separation of concerns and clear module boundaries.</p>

        <h2>Architectural Patterns</h2>
        <p>Several patterns have emerged as best practices for modern web applications:</p>

        <h3>Microservices Architecture</h3>
        <p>Breaking down applications into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.</p>

        <h3>JAMstack</h3>
        <p>JavaScript, APIs, and Markup - a modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt markup.</p>

        <h2>Technology Considerations</h2>
        <p>Choosing the right technology stack is crucial for long-term success:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Frontend frameworks: React, Vue, Angular</li>
          <li>Backend technologies: Node.js, Python, Go</li>
          <li>Databases: SQL vs NoSQL considerations</li>
          <li>Caching strategies: Redis, CDNs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
        <p>Performance should be considered from the beginning of the design process, not as an afterthought.</p>
